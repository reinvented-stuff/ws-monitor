# ws-monitor

Attach to your message quere over websocket and inspect all messages with a UI we made for you.

## What's supported

We currently suport Firefox, Chrome and maybe something else.

To communicate with the Message Queue we use STOMP over Websocket protocol, and target RabbitMQ with its web-stomp plugin.
